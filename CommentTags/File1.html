    <p>A comment is text that doesnâ€™t affect the outcome of a code, it is just a piece of 
      text to let someone know what you have done in a program or what is being done in a block of code.</p>
    <p>Comments are the way to improve the readability of a code, by explaining what we have done in code in simple english. </p>
    
    <p> Syntax for HTML Comments:</p>
    <!--This is a comment-->
    <!--Anything written in this text won't be displayed 
       on the html output page-->
  </body>
